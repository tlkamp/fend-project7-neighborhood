# Neighborhood Map
A map of my stops during my recent vacation to [Iceland](https://www.inspiredbyiceland.com/).

## Dependencies
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - the UI Framework.
* [React-Router-DOM](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) - for keeping the URL synchronized.
* [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) - for the style.

## Starting the App
1. Ensure Node and NPM are installed.
2. Clone or download this repository - note the location where the files are stored.
3. Open a terminal in the location where the files are stored and run:

```shell
$ npm install && npm start
```
 A browser window should open and take you to the site. If it doesn't, you can navigate to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) (or click the link!).

## Stopping the App
To stop the server, hit `control + c` in the terminal window where it is running.
